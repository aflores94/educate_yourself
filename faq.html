            <li>Who are you?</li>
            My name is Andrea Flores. I'm an anti-racist, native Texan, and data analyst. 
            <br>
            I created this website out of immense anger, sadness, and frustration after the murders of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and George Floyd.
            <br><br>
            <li>How do I submit a resource?</li>
            If you want to submit a resource, please use the form <a target="_blank" href="resource_form.html">here</a>.
            You will recieve an email when it's added to the site. Thank you for contributing to our efforts!
